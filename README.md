<!--

This README file provides an overview and instructions for setting up and using the CRUD API built with FastAPI. The API allows for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on resources.

Security Considerations:
- Ensure that all endpoints are protected with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent SQL injection and other common attacks.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
